### Functionality 
This application uses the Python OpenCV libraries - DLIB and CV2 to perform face tracking in real-time. Using the edge coordinates of the face, a note is associated on the virtual piano. This note is played using the pygame module. 


### Requirements
* Python 
* OpenCV (cv2)
* dlib
* pygame 

### Set-up
* OpenCV installation 
- This might be a bit of a hassle but here is a good walkthrough or the same (https://towardsdatascience.com/install-and-configure-opencv-4-2-0-in-windows-10-python-7a7386ae024)  

* Dlib installation is included the above walkthrough 
* **To install these packages you can use `pip install [package_name]`**
